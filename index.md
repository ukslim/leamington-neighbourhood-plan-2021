# Leamington Neighbourhood Plan 2021 - The Hartnup Summary

On 6th May 2021 we are being asked to vote on the Neighbourhood Plan for Leamington Spa.

Here is Warwick District Council's home for all information about the plan: https://www.leamingtonspatowncouncil.gov.uk/Neighbourhood-Plan-.aspx

Here is an information statement for voters, direct from the WDC web page: https://www.leamingtonspatowncouncil.gov.uk/controls/DownloadDocument.ashx?docID=gd3430IVSVBFMTUTVI1658vNov&aID=2484 

Here is the final full plan: https://www.leamingtonspatowncouncil.gov.uk/controls/DownloadDocument.ashx?docID=dr6794ESZZQYFMJGJR5648aHwu&aID=2484 

The Leamington Neighbourhood Plan lives alongside the Warwick District Plan, which has already been adopted, and is here: https://www.warwickdc.gov.uk/info/20410/new_local_plan - a lot of the Neighbourhood plan is about classifying areas of Leamington. The details of what that classification means is in the district plan.

## What's on this page?

The final plan document is 107 pages long, and I've seen people complain that it's incomprehensible waffle. So here I seek to extract the core part that you're voting on, without the waffle.

## How have you done that?

The first 24 pages of the document is essentially introductory background - including a pretty lengthy description of the town and its history. The last 30-ish pages is appendices. So I've skipped all those. The rest is the plan itself.

The plan is a set of policies, which the council planning committee will use to guide them for the next 10 years. The rest of the document contains these policies, which is what you are voting on, plus "Objectives" and "Backround/Justification". I've trimmed off the objectives, background and justification, keeping only the policies themselves. If you want to see the background and justification, I encourage you to use the full document to find out. 

## Who are you?

I'm a Warwick resident (I don't get to vote on this), with no connection to the council, and no commercial interest in anything affected by the plan. I'm interested because I spend a lot of time in Leamington.

## Shouldn't the council have done this?

Maybe, but maybe they had good reasons not to. I don't know. It doesn't matter, I've done it now.

## How do I know this is accurate?

I've tried my best, but if you have doubts, go to the full document from Warwick District Council.

## Get on with it.

OK, here goes:

# Summary of the Neighbourhood Plan policies

## Policy RLS1 – Housing Development Within the Royal Leamington Spa Urban Area

Proposals for new housing development within the Royal Leamington Spa Urban Area, as defined in the adjacent Figure 6, will be supported for the following:

1. Re-use of previously developed land and buildings when not in conflict with other development plan policies.
2. Infill development that is of an appropriate scale and that does not lead to the loss of residential gardens (unless in accordance with Policy H1 of the Warwick District Local Plan), overdevelopment, or have a significant adverse impact on the amenity of adjacent existing
occupiers and uses.
3. Proposals for custom and self-build housing provision that are
acceptable when assessed against Warwick District Local Plan Policy
H15.
4. Proposals for purpose-built student accommodation when positively
assessed against all related development plan requirements and guidance.
Within the Court Street area (as defined in allocation H16 of the Warwick District Local Plan) community-led housing and the provision of live/work units will be supported.

Development proposals for previously developed land, where appropriate, should undertake a surface water outfall assessment, following the Drainage Hierarchy (National Planning Practice Guidance , paragraph 80) to determine if there are viable alternatives to existing connections to the combined sewer network.

## Policy RLS2 – Housing Design

Development proposals are encouraged to adopt higher environmental standards of building design and energy performance, such as the Passivhaus approach or similar. The use of ‘Building for Life’, or an equivalent assessment framework, should be demonstrated in the justification of proposals.

## Policy RLS3 – Conservation Areas

Development proposals that are within or directly affect a Conservation Area must assess and address their impact on their heritage significance. Proposals must demonstrate attention to the following where relevant:

a) The proposed building type, style, materials and colours in relation to the character area in which it is located and its distinguishing features;

b) Therelationshipoftheproposedlayouttotheexistingroadpattern,plot sizes, and the balance between buildings and garden spaces;

c) Building height, scale and rooflines sympathetic to the local setting;

d) How the development interfaces with and respects the significance
listed buildings and non-designated heritage assets, landmark buildings, classical set pieces, parks and gardens, watercourses and the canal;

e) Retention or enhancement of gardens, open spaces, trees and, where possible, inclusion of new tree planting;

f) Retention, restoration and reinstatement of period details e.g. decoration, ornamentation, ironwork;

g) Retention and creation of off-street car parking;

h) Retention and reinstatement of shopfronts in accordance with Policy RLS17 of this plan;

i) Use of hard and soft landscaping and suitable boundary treatments
when considered in relation to the surrounding local context;

j) Protection of key groupings of buildings as identified in the
Conservation Area Assessment;

k) Appropriate assessment of any remains of archaeological value,
including field evaluation where existing information is absent;

l) Protection of key views especially of landmark buildings, classical set
pieces, parks and gardens, bridges, the rivers and canal and at key gateways and along key thoroughfares, all as identified in the Conservation Area Assessment; and

m)Identifying and reinforcing any links with the town’s historic past, such as the spa town, railway and canal legacies.

## Policy RLS4 – Housing Character Outside the Conservation Areas

In residential areas, outside of the neighbourhood area’s Conservation Areas, applicants should demonstrate how housing development proposals (e.g. infill, extensions and other changes requiring planning consent) have taken into account, and responded to, the predominant character (including local building styles and materials) in the street/road/locality within which the proposed development will be situated.

Proposals should retain and, where applicable, create appropriately located and surfaced off-street car parking.

Street trees should be retained or as a last resort replaced with suitable native species planting in the immediate area. Housing development of garden land will not be permitted unless it meets the requirements of Local Plan Policy H1

Innovative and contemporary design that respects and responds in a positive manner to local character will be supported.

Proposals should where applicable seek to maintain views of higher slopes, skylines and the wider landscape.

## Policy RLS5 – Royal Leamington Spa Housing Mix and Tenure

Within the Neighbourhood Area that mix should, where applicable:

a) Be informed by a rigorous and up-to-date assessment of housing needs;

b) Take opportunities to provide detached and semi-detached family homes which are currently underprovided;

c) Within South Leamington, seek to rebalance the existing rented/owner occupied mix by the provision of homes for affordable owner occupation.
